# Analog Watch ⏰

A simple analog watch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This watch shows the current time by updating hour, minute, and second hands in real-time using JavaScript’s `setInterval` function.

## Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Clock hands adjust every second to reflect the current time.
- **Classic Design**: A clean, minimalist analog clock interface.
- **Dynamic Animation**: Smooth movement of clock hands using CSS and JavaScript.

## How It Works
The clock calculates the position of each hand based on the current time, using `setInterval` to update every second. JavaScript sets the rotation angle for each hand, while CSS handles styling.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structures the clock elements.
- **CSS** – Styles the clock and animates hands.
- **JavaScript** – Calculates time and updates DOM.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamPeterberg/analog-watch.git
2.Open index.html in a browser to view the analog watch.
